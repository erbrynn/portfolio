		<h2>Beijing - 2019</h2>
	</div>

	<div class = "beijing-text">
		<p> In spring break of 2019, my mom and I traveled to Beijing for a week. We visited the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and other touristy places around the city. We ate a lot of really good food and I was stuffed at the end of every day. These pictures were taken in early March, when the trees are just starting to bloom but aren't fully green yet.</p>
