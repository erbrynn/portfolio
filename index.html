      <p>My name is Erin Brynn and I'm a junior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I'm studying on the user experience design path - that means that I work to make products and interfaces (including this one) easy to use for everyone. I just recently started working on these types of projects, but I've been taking pictures my whole life, and much of my work can be seen on the other pages of this site. <br> <br>
      In my free time, I enjoy riding horses, playing the viola, and hanging out with friends. I'm on the equestrian team at school and ride at my barn at home as well. My love for photography began with taking pictures of horses; I used to take my family's DSLR to the barn and take pictures of whatever I found interesting. My photography has evolved some since then, but I'll never forget how I started.</p>
