		<h2> Hawaii - 2018 </h2>

	<div class = "hawaii-text">
		<p> Over winter break in 2018, my family took a trip to the island of Kauai. The first day we were there, we took a helicopter ride around the entire island. All the above photos were taken from the helicopter. We flew up the Napali coast, weaved in and out of the mountains on the north side of the island, and flew into the crater that was created by Kauai's volcano. This crater gets the most rain of anywhere else on Earth - you can see that the walls of the crater are permanently covered in small waterfalls. This was by far the coolest thing I had ever done, and I'm glad I had my camera with me to document it. </p>
