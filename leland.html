		<p> These pictures are from time I've spent in the northern part of Michigan, which I'm convinced is one of the best places on Earth. Some of the pictures are of my friend and her horse; they've been my main models since I started taking pictures when I was 13. Her family owns a winery in the Leelanau Peninsula, and I have many summers up there, where we've waterskiied on Lake Leelanau and wandered through the vineyards with our horses.</p>
